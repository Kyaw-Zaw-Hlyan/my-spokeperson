I have taken a short course on conceptual helicopter design which was lectured by Prof.
Arvind Sinha who is from Melbourne University. The course lasted 5 days and we made a conceptual design of a firefighting helicopter for bushfires in Thailand.
The visiting professor taught us what are the most important things when we consider a conceptual design of a VTOL vehicle, how we should extract design requirements based on operation, mission, flight performance, and logistics.
We learnt to draw mission profiles based on the terrain in which our helicopter would operate.
